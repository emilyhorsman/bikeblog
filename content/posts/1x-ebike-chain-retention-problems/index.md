Front derailleurs not only shift between your chainrings but also help to ensure the chain doesn't fall off. Chains fall off fairly easily and I imagine this is by design to allow derailleurs to fulfill the function their name implies. Bikes with only a single chainring usually include some chain retention component. My e-bike has a 1x crankset (an [FC-E6100](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/city---trekking-e-bike-e6100-series/FC-E6100.html)) with an outboard chain guard. This ensures the chain will not fall off the ring towards the outside of the bike.

I was lubing the chain on my e-bike and noticed the chain guard was loose. This particular one mounts directly to the chainring with some #2 Philips screws. These are dainty screws and don't take much torque so it's easy to lose these out on a ride.

Tightening them all solved my problems but it was a good reminder that I still have the problem of inboard chain retention. Having the chain fall off inboard on this e-bike is a bigger problem than on a normal bike because it gets quite stuck between the drive unit cover and the ring. This happened to me on the trail the other day and I needed to work with someone else to pry the chain out. This chain is approaching the end of its life (around 0.5% wear) and I was in my easiest gear when it happened (and thus the chain is at its most extreme angle) â€” these are both factors that make this more likely. Nonetheless, I'd like to avoid this situation ever happening again.

I have long-term plans to upgrade the drivetrain on this bike â€” perhaps to Shimano CUES â€” which would include a rear derailleur with a clutch. A clutch makes it harder for the tension pulley of the rear derailleur cage to pivot forwards and thus lose tension on the chain. This makes it harder to for the chain to slap against the chainstay and reduces the chain bouncing around in general. This is my best guess of how my chain fell off the other day. This might help in the future but I was going to go through a few chains on this drivetrain first (I think the rear derailleur has been bent the entire time I've had this bike and so if I can get this cassette to the end of its life then all will need replacing anyway). I'd also prefer something that offers more of a guarantee.

This crankset is sold in configurations with an inner chain guard too â€” see this [cool exploded view](https://si.shimano.com/en/ev/FC-E6100-4439). I could get that part from Shimano and it might fit and that would certainly solve my issue. However, I worry about how fragile and finnicky these plastic chain guards are and I low-key hate Philips screws on my bike.

My favourite solution would be a narrow-wide chainring which is what you tend to see for chain retention. The drive unit on this e-bike is a [DU-E6100](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/city---trekking-e-bike-e6100-series/DU-E6100.html) which has the chainring mount to the drive unit instead of the spindle or crank (which has the weird consequence of being able to turn the crank backwards without moving the chainring). The [SM-CRE61](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/city---trekking-e-bike-e6100-series/SM-CRE61.html) chainring currently installed gives a 46.5mm [chainline](https://www.parktool.com/en-us/blog/repair-help/chainline-concepts) so I'd need a narrow-wide ring that's compatible with the drive unit mount and has a similar chainline. Wolf Tooth [sells one](https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/products/direct-mount-chainrings-shimano-e-bike-motor?variant=40023284023331) but the chainline is 55mm and they only advertise it working on different Shimano motor units. I'm not sure if the splines are the same. Shimano's [compatibility chart](https://productinfo.shimano.com/#/com?cid=C-431&acid=C-657) claims I can use chainrings from some of those other motor units so it's very possible the splines are the same! Shimano's [SM-CRE80](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/ep6-ep600/SM-CRE80.html) has a similar chainline (50mm) and has "Dynamic Chain Engagement+" which seems like their version of a narrow-wide tooth profile â€” gotta love Shimano's marketing team. This is probably the way to go.

Another solution is using a chain keeper. My understanding is these were more popular before the ubiquity of narrow-wide chainrings â€” although you still see them on some mountain bikes where they expect the chain to bounce around a lot. This would involve removing the outboard chain guard all together (ðŸ’¯) and clamping a keeper to the seat tube over the chain. Paul Component Engineering makes a [very beautiful purple one](https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/components/drivetrain/chain-keepers/chain-keeper/) which has a clever design that allows it work with a 34 to 55mm chainline. However, I think the mountable area on the seat tube would be too high to have the chain block sit right over the chain because the drive unit prevents it from going further down.

[Wolf Tooth makes one](https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/chainguides/products/gnarwolf-chainguide-seat-tube-clamp-mount) that I think would solve the clearance issues because the seat tube clamp is much higher than the chain block.

There are also a variety of chain deflectors out there which act more like an inner chain guard instead of protecting inboard and outboard. This might work since I have the outer chain guard. It may at least stop the chain from getting stuck when it does fall inboard. Many of these have the same clearance issue as the Paul Chain Keeper since the retention part is basically at the same height as the mount.

Then there are chain cases which mount directly to the drive unit like Shimano's [SM-CDE80](https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/product/component/mtb-ebike-e8000/SM-CDE80.html). The compatibility chart doesn't list any compatible chain case with this DU-E6100 drive unit however its [exploded view](https://si.shimano.com/en/ev/DU-E6100-4436) does show the appropriate mounts for a chain case and even lists fixing screws for one. All the ones I can find which might mount to the drive unit have a wider chainline than this current setup would allow for.

You can see the threads for a chain case in this photo (and some scraped paint from the chain pryed out).

A classic trick is to use an old front derailleur as a chain keeper â€” you set the limit screws to keep the cage over the chain just like a chain keeper and then you skip the shift cable. I think there may be similar clearance issues but if I have time I might experiment with this approach to at least have a temporary solution.

Post coming on whatever I end up with ðŸ˜…
