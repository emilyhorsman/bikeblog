RIP my Ricoh GR III which is finally giving up. It fell out when I went over a cable ramp from some construction with my stem caddy open. That busted the image stabilization. Now the motherboard battery seems to be going. So this post includes some of the last photos taken with it. I may not replace it because I don't like how unrepairable they are. Anywho, let's look at some coyotes!!

This one was howling for a long while by a road in Golden Gate Park. It didn't seem disturbed by all the passing humans, which is [unfortunate](https://sfrecpark.org/1399/Urban-Wildlife).

>If you are comfortable doing so, we encourage you to “haze” the coyote, which means trying to scare the animal off by making loud noises, waving your arms, and appearing as large as possible. Hazing a coyote does not put you at risk of being hurt by the coyote and is an effective way of restoring an individual animal’s natural fear of humans.

And this one on the left was running through JFK Promenade — hi sweet pupper ❤️.

By the way, cars are the [number one cause of death for coyotes](https://sfstandard.com/2022/11/12/4-myths-about-sf-coyotes-debunked/) in San Francisco. Another reason for more car-free areas, _especially_ in the park.[^1]
