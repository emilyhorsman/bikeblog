RIP my Ricoh GR III which is finally giving up. It fell out when I went over a cable ramp from some construction with my stem caddy open. That busted the image stabilization. Now the motherboard battery seems to be going. So this post includes some of the last photos taken with it. I may not replace it because I don't like how unrepairable they are.
