The [Fall Into Slow Streets Slow Ride (instagram)](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyg-hdAp0ZI/) was a couple Saturdays ago and it was a great time. I don't ride down as far as Bernal often and it's way more pleasant to do in a group.

We met at Dolores Park and then rode down Valencia. I'm not in the new center running bike lane (ðŸ¤®) much. Taking the traffic lane as a group was the right call.

Frog and Toad are canonically queer, for the record.

It's been a hot minute since I was on 24th in Noe Valley.

Slow Sanchez!

Our group was so cute going over the little bridge off Arlington.

Riding on Mission is _definitely_ better with friends.

Our longer stop for lunch was at Precita Park. This means Atlas gets to stretch out with his wheels!

Slow Noe!

We all got off our bikes to get around an event on Noe. There are two Bromptons in this photo, and I think there was a third at the ride!

And we ended at Duboce Park after three hours of joyous riding.
