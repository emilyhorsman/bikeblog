title: Grease Port Bolt Extraction
summary: Another win for bolt extractor bits.

Success! The grease port screw on my left pedal was seized. I couldn't get enough torque into it to free it without camming out. I hate when bike products use Philips heads.

I used a bolt extractor drill bit and it came out easy! The bearing replacement then took five minutes and worked perfectly.
