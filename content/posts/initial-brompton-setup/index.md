## Things To Fix

Most nearly-assembled bikes from a factory have a litany of problems. It's one reason I'm against direct-to-consumer bikes. Sure, they tell you to take them to a bike shop for assembly. That's a bad deal for the bike shop though.[^1] Or you don't, and most folks are going to end up not finding subtle problems. My [Kona Dew-E]({{< ref "/tags/egret" >}}) had so many things to adjust.[^2] My Brompton came folded up in the box from the distributor and the only assembly was putting the saddle/Pentaclip on.

[^1]: Bike shop doesn't get the margin from a sale. But they get a shitty margin on the high-labor task of assembling a random direct-to-consumer bike. Of course, some are better than others.
[^2]: A particularly annoying one just as an example: the battery mount was not correctly fastened. This made it very hard to get the battery in and out. Eventually the mount loosened up enough that the battery lock didn't even retain the battery. I once had the battery fall out when I accidentally put some pressure on it while carrying the bike. Shimano offers a gauge to align and set the length of the battery mount correctly. But that's a niche tool and kind of expensive.

1. The barrel adjusters on the brakes were loose and in different states out of the box. They probably shook loose during shipping and this is difficult to avoid but it might not be something everyone catches.
1. Front fender was misaligned.

## Seatpost Slipping

This one gets its own section because its an infamous and stubborn issue with Bromptons. This is the biggest issue I've had so far. If you search "seatpost slipping" on r/brompton you'll find a loooot of results.

Brompton seatposts are designed to operate grease-free. Any contaminant, including fingerprint oil or residues from manufacturing, can cause them to slip. This isn't called out in the owner's manual as much as it should be, IMO. There's a bit in the "Cleaning & Lubrication" section that notes not to grease them.

>When lubricating your Brompton, avoid getting oil or grease on the seatpost or the wheel rims.

But nowhere do they explicitly say not to touch the seatpost with your hands, which seems to be the long-term solution for many.

A mechanic who works on a lot of Bromptons told me that the quick release nut is always undertightened from the factory. There's some mixed messaging on how much you can safely tighten this before you risk frame damage. The seat clamp [datasheet](https://us.brompton.com/support/bikes/c-line/manuals-and-datasheets) says:

>As a guide, with the seat clamp lever forward (i.e. done up), the adjustor nut AN should be tightened with a torque in the range 4-7NM and the maximum closing force needed at the end of the lever while securing the clamp should lie in the range 80-120N. The correct setting will depend on the weight and strength of the user.

The official Brompton YouTube channel says not to have more than 3mm of exposed thread past the nylock ([timestamped video](https://youtu.be/KIA8ylq_-Po?si=PaZtBsdx2wN7yv4k&t=262)). I tightened it bit-by-bit until I hit that 3mm point and this did not fix my issue.

I've also heard that the seat post sleeve is over-reamed from the factory. This means you need to get a new one and you need to have it reamed with a special tool.
