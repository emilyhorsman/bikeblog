title: It’s Fall Y’all! 🎃💦 Time for Fenders

summary: We're getting into wet season so I begrudingly put fenders on my e-bike. Kona was a bit sly about the tire/fender clearance so I used a heat gun to open up the rear fender clearance a bit. It worked but it looks real bad.

I've resisted putting fenders on any of my bikes — I don't love the aesthetic, they feel fragile, and you still need to wear rain gear anyway. However, I did some of my favourite riding in the rain last wet season and my Kona Dew-E came with some cheap plastic fenders. I had taken them off when I assembled it but we've started getting some rain in San Francisco and I figure it's time. Besides, they protect your drivetrain too and I think it's responsible to have things last as long as possible.

This bike came with 47mm tires on 19mm internal width rims. I put on a tubeless wheelset with wider rims (26.6mm internal width) and the effective width of the tire is about 50mm. I think that Kona was already playing a bit fast and loose with clearances here — the fenders it came with are arguably a bit narrow for 47mm tires. When I decided I was gonna put fenders on for the wet season I figured I'd put some metal [Honjo fenders](https://www.sim.works/collections/fenders-simworks-by-honjo/products/smooth-62-black) on but I don't think that the frame can fit them. Not without some shenanigans anyway.[^1] So given that I'm not even a huge fan of fenders I figure I'll just put on the fenders the bike came with until they break. Anyway, this is all to say that this tire/rim/frame/fender combination isn't ideal and I didn't get that sweet French Fender Line™️ I would've loved. The result was good enough for me[^2] and it will give a good picture of clearances for the future.

[^1]: I thought about dimpling or cutting notches into some metal fenders to clear the fork legs. I might try this in the future.
[^2]: Especially on this bike. One nice thing about e-bikes is that they start off kind of ugly so it's fine if I do some unsightly things to them.
