The original concept for this bike was a wide range 2x. The 1x we put on was borrowed from my old bike just to see if this Bridgestone would work for Kat. Her 1992 Trek has a wide range 2x with drop bars and friction shifters. She decided to put [ENE Wing](http://www.diacompe.com.tw/product/ene-wing-shifter/) shifters and a wider range 2x on the Trek and move her Trek's [ENE Thumb](http://www.diacompe.com.tw/product/ene-thumb-shifter/) shifters to the BB-1. So we took a bunch of parts off the Trek.

Thanks, Multitrack. We appreciate it. We also love function specific design. Also known as design. Also get a load of that [0mm Discord stem](https://tanglefootcycles.com/discord/wright-stem-0-30mm/) with some beautiful thin rust under the clear cerakote.

And here it is! 11-42t with a 24/40 and shifts great.

BUT! Kat ended up going back to a 1x for a couple of reasons:

1. Preferred the experience of a 1x on trails once it had a friction thumb shifter instead of the SRAM trigger shifter she didn't vibe with.
1. The clearance between the tire and chain in the easiest gear was really tight. Even with a 127.5mm spindle bottom bracket.

So, this is the second strike on rear tire width (see [part 1]({{< ref "/posts/kats-bb-1-part-1" >}})).

## Gearing

The 11-42t with 24/40 had a gear range of 15.1–96.1 gear inches. The 11-51t with 28t chainring gives a range of 14.5–67.2 gear inches. And the same with a 32t chainring gives a range of 16.6–76.9 gear inches. There's a 32t on order. That's a top speed of 20.6mph when pedalling at 90 RPM. Totally sufficient (in general but definitely for this bike).

outline:

1. tire clearance woes, switching to a gravelking in the rear
1. trying out the sakae 2x
1. switching around from the trek, stealing its shifters so the trek gets the wing shifters
1. putting the 1x back on with a bronze cap and deore cassette 11-51t (gear range?) and with friction shifters. works with an rd-m8000-sgs
1. mark's rack to fit the fab's fanny
