My Marin Nicasio 2 is the first bike I bought when I moved back to San Francisco. It's still the bike I have the most mileage on and I've been through a lot with it. I haven't ridden it for a long while due to bike fit and health problems. It's a more aggressive position than the bikes I tend to ride these days. But my wrist issues are getting managed and I keep learning more about how to get comfortable on a bike.

My other bikes are objectively more rad but I keep missing this bike. Especially after riding the Brompton since it's got that more nimble and responsive feeling to it — like the Marin does — that my slacker, chiller bikes don't. There _was_ a point where this bike felt like a glove, that wonderful feeling of having the bike be an extension of your body.

I'm going to get this bike rolling again. It'll be with the stock 700c wheels. I built 650b wheels for this bike but Kat rebuilt them for [egret]({{< ref "/tags/egret" >}}). Those 650b wheels had centerlock hubs and I think my lack of caution there damaged the fork from lockring rub. (At least, that's the working theory. Shoutout to bean for pointing it out.)

I could get the fork repaired. I think carbon should be repaired more often since its so ubiquitous now and the environmental cost of carbon components is high. However, I also ran a dangerously high stem on this fork before I knew better. It's not good to do that with carbon steerers because they're not designed for that kind of leverage. I didn't run it for long and I certainly wasn't biking very hard during that time. But nonetheless I'm starting to think it might be better to replace the fork. I can get something reputable from ENVE and not always be worrying about it in the back of my head.

tbh I'd put a steel fork in here but the lower headset is 1 1/2". I'm not sure many, if any, tapered steerer steel forks exist and I don't think I can use a [head tube reducer](https://www.fsaproshop.com/products/1-5-headtube-reducer-cups) since it's an integrated race — not external cup. I might be able to use a [52/30 Cane Creek crown race](https://canecreek.com/product/crown-races/). Although Paragon sells a [tapered steel steerer](https://www.paragonmachineworks.com/stem-parts/steerer-tubes/steel-tapered-steerer-choose-size.html). Maybe custom fork time?
