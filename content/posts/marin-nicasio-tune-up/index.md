This Marin Nicasio 2 is the first bike I bought when I moved back to San Francisco. It's still the bike I have the most mileage on and I've been through a lot with it. I haven't ridden it for a long while due to bike fit and health problems. It's a more aggressive position than the bikes I tend to ride these days. But my wrist issues are getting managed and I keep learning more about how to get comfortable on a bike.

My other bikes are objectively more rad but I keep missing this bike. Especially after riding the Brompton since it's got that more nimble and responsive feeling to it — like the Marin does — that my slacker, chiller bikes don't. There _was_ a point where this bike felt like a glove, that wonderful feeling of having the bike be an extension of your body.

I did a 650b conversion on this bike back when it was my only bike. Those hubs and rims are on [egret]({{< ref "/tags/egret" >}}) now. I'm going to put the stock 700c wheels back on — now it'll be my only 700c bike.
