## Around San Francisco

The ravens, crows, and starlings are always scooting around in front of the new(ish) Andytown location on the Great Highway.

The _heliotropium_ smelled so nice in Strawberry Hill.

One of Kat's favourite trails in Golden Gate Park is part of the [old 7-line streetcar right-of-way](http://opensfhistory.org/Display/wnp14.13402.jpg). You can still bike through this [same tunnel as pictured in 1947](http://opensfhistory.org/Display/wnp14.13321.jpg). The sand has been too deep to bike up the hill from MLK to the trail for the whole summer and we're still not quite there yet. Sometimes you gotta walk the rest!
