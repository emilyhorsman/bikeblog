The start of the month had some warm nights with low winds â€” one night I checked the [Golden Gate Bridge wind dashboard](https://dashboard.hobolink.com/public/GGBWestSidewalk#/) and got stoked at the 6 mph winds. We rode from the Outer Richmond to the vista point after the east sidewalk on the bridge.

Atlas in the Burley trailer is coming with us! His first ride over the bridge and it probably won't be the last.

It's so rare that I bike on the east sidewalk! The bridge is so majestic when you have it all to yourself and there's no crosswind. An enormous treat.

## Bike Party

We had several dozen riders on the Golden Gate Bridge and security wouldn't open the north gate for us so we all had to turn around mid-bridge. Apparently they told the front of the group it was commuters only. Marin ðŸ™„. A smaller group of us went back later and then caught up with the group at Dolores Park and it was great!

Angel Island completely in the dark. I'd like to do some bikecamping there one day. Two amazing nights crossing the bridge in a row!

## Around San Francisco

The _heliotropium_ smelled so nice in Strawberry Hill.

One of Kat's favourite trails in Golden Gate Park is part of the [old 7-line streetcar right-of-way](http://opensfhistory.org/Display/wnp14.13402.jpg). You can still bike through this [same tunnel as pictured in 1947](http://opensfhistory.org/Display/wnp14.13321.jpg). The sand has been too deep to bike up the hill from MLK to the trail for the whole summer and you get stuck.

We got some rain at the end of the month and now we're good to go though!
