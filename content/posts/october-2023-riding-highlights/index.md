Warmest month of the year here in San Francisco!

## Golden Gate Bridge

The start of the month had some warm nights with low winds â€” I checked the [wind dashboard](https://dashboard.hobolink.com/public/GGBWestSidewalk#/) on a particularly warm night and got stoked at the 6 mph winds. We rode from the Outer Richmond to the vista point after the east sidewalk on the bridge.

Atlas came with us in the Burley trailer! The first ride over the bridge (and probably not the last) for this 13 year old pug.

It's so rare that I bike on the east sidewalk! The bridge is so majestic when you have it all to yourself and there's no crosswind. An enormous treat. I'll treasure this moment on the north tower forever.

## Tennessee Valley Beach

My favourite ride of the month was this loop from the city to Tennessee Valley Beach and back via headlands trails.

We took 8th Ave up to [Slow Lake St](https://www.slowlakestreet.com). Ben's out on his new(ish) Crust Romanceur build.

{{< image src="R0006579.jpg" alt="Ben on his Crust Romanceur in an orange hoodie that reads 'Slow is Forever' leaning against a colorful truck at a traffic stop." >}}

Treated to a foggy bridge crossing.

The Conzelman parking lot is the place for re-upping on sunscreen and for obligatory bike detail photos.

This tree hanging over Conzelman Rd at this bend always hits.

We got the best mix of fog and blue skies on this ride. It was really rolling down the Julian trail.

{{< image src="DSCF4137.jpg" alt="Kat descending a twisty bit of the gravel Julian trail. Fog is coming down the hill in the background." >}}

The Julian trail takes you on to Bunker Rd for a bit before turning on to the Rodeo Valley trail.

Bobcat is the trail we're all most excited about. Here's Jerry and Sarah making their way up.

{{< image src="DSCF4249.jpg" alt="Jerry and Sarah biking up around a bend of a hill with a bush poking out of the hill on their right and fog rolling in to the left" >}}

Near the top of Bobcat you'll find the [special tree](https://www.scenicroutessf.com/)!

{{< image src="DSCF4267.jpg" alt="Kat and Ben standing in front of the oak tree from the Scenic Routes logo." >}}

Gotta get that oak detail.

{{< image src="DSCF4286.jpg" alt="A close up of the oak tree with the Marin hills in the background." >}}

Living for that mix of blue skies and fog.

Ben and Sarah needed to collect rocks, as geologists.

{{< image src="DSCF4332.jpg" alt="Ben and Sarah crouched on the ground looking at rocks." >}}

It's important to take product photography with your friends' bikes leaning against things.

Off we go to the top of Bobcat.

The views of the headlands at the top of Bobcat don't disappoint.

Sadly, Goldberg isn't on this ride with us. But the Goldsmobile is still ready to rip down Marincello.

{{< image src="R0006633.jpg" alt="Sarah at the crest of a hill" >}}

Marincello was a really fun descent. I didn't really get any photos. It was my first time on Marincello and I'm excited to climb it soon to see it at a slower pace. Marincello takes us down to our destination: Tennessee Valley Beach. By this point in the day it was getting quite gloomy on the coast.

Tennessee Valley.

{{< image src="DSCF4524.jpg" alt="Fog rolling down the hills behind a horse stable and grasses" >}}

We took the Tennessee Valley Rd to the Mill Valley path back into the city. Going through Fort Baker skips some of the cycling abomination that is Sausalito and you get this view of the city. It was getting real cold by this point.

## Rob Hill

Sarah and Ben did a small overnighter at Rob Hill in the Presidio. Kat, Jerry, and I tagged along for the ride up and the e-bike carried a bunch of firewood up with a Burley trailer.

{{< image src="R0006695.jpg" alt="Jerry, Ben, and Kat climbing up Battery Caulfield in the golden hour glow" >}}

You gotta get that new bike detail shot in the campfire glow.

## Pumpkin Patch!! ðŸŽƒ

Kat and I have been wanting to load up our bikes with pumpkins for ages. We finally got a group together and went to Clancy's pumpkin patch to do it. The location across from Garden for the Environment, of course.

First, a quick Great Highway lap to celebrate the season. The clouds over the Marin headlands were amazing that day.

{{< image src="R0006770.jpg" alt="Kat, Jerry, and Sarah riding northbound on the Great Highway facing the headlands with a blue sky and lots of broken up clouds" >}}

Say hello to the turkeys! Kat and I were holding armfuls of pumpkins at this point.

The bikes and their hauls.

Atlas was thrilled to be riding with two new pals.

What else are racks for?

## Bike Party

We had several dozen riders on the Golden Gate Bridge and security wouldn't open the north gate for us so we all had to turn around mid-bridge. Apparently they told the front of the group it was commuters only. Marin ðŸ™„. A smaller group of us went back later and then caught up with the group at Dolores Park and it was great!

{{< image src="DSCF4034.jpg" alt="A view of the San Francisco skyline at night from the north." >}}

Angel Island completely in the dark. I'd like to do some bikecamping there one day. Two amazing nights crossing the bridge in a row!

{{< image src="DSCF4008.jpg" alt="A view of Angel Island in the dark with the East Bay behind it" >}}

Our small bridge crew catching back up to the rest of Bike Party. (Also shoutout to the 33 trolley bus!)

## Last Minute Hawk Hills

It's starting to get dark so soon ðŸ˜­. I went up Hawk Hill at the last minute one night it was going in and out of rain and drama. I saw a coyote wandering around Conzelman and turned up my music to scare it off. I love seeing them tho!

{{< image src="DSCF4930.jpg" alt="The Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco skyline at night with a straight line of clouds just barely above it." >}}

Moody descent.

The moon over the bridge was stunning. I would do this exact same ride every day.

## Around San Francisco

Goldberg tried out Atlas' doggles.

The _heliotropium_ smelled so nice in Strawberry Hill.

One of Kat's favourite trails in Golden Gate Park is part of the [old 7-line streetcar right-of-way](http://opensfhistory.org/Display/wnp14.13402.jpg). You can still bike through this [same tunnel as pictured in 1947](http://opensfhistory.org/Display/wnp14.13321.jpg). The sand has been too deep to bike up the hill from MLK to the trail for the whole summer and you get stuck.

{{< image src="R0006290.jpg" alt="The rear of a bike in front of a track of sand" >}}

We got some rain at the end of the month and now we're good to go though! The end of that trail brings you to La Playa St and near that is the new Andytown location and the terminus of the 5, 5R, and 31 Muni routes. An appropriate spot for this sign.

{{< image src="R0006299.jpg" alt="Some corvids standing beside a sign that reads 'Loitering Encouraged This is a Nice Place'" >}}

One of my favourite trails in the park always gets the best dappled light.

{{< image src="R0006283.jpg" alt="Kat standing over her bike on a dirt trail surrounded by eucalyptus trees creating shadows over the path" >}}

I'm not sure if this path in Golden Gate Park has a name but it was bursting with mushrooms early in the month.

{{< image src="R0006367.jpg" alt="My Kona e-bike and Kat's purple vintage Trek under a large tree" >}}

I took a loop around the music concourse while waiting for some takeout to be ready and look! This ferris wheel is now relocated to the piers. I will miss its glow but not its fossil fuel generator.

{{< image src="DSCF4587-Enhanced-NR.jpg" alt="The Skystar ferris wheel glowing in the fog." >}}

Safe Street Rebel hosted a group slow ride around some slow streets in the Mission and Bernal Heights.

## Free Palestine

Shoutout to the bike marshals at the Gaza rally this month.
