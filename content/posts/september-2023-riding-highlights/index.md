I rode a new monthly record of 803 km and it was filled with pleasant rides with friends in and out of the city. The ebike helped a lot here and there were many bonus kilometers from picking up food takeout that I normally would've been too tired to do. We've sworn off delivery because we don't want to put more cars on the road and Uber, DoorDash, et. al. are [killing restaurants](https://web.archive.org/web/20230930230743/https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/sf-little-star-pizza-challenges-food-delivery-apps-18142694.php) and cities.

## Ravenswood Trail

I had [this trail](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/don-edwards-san-francisco-bay/map?trail=ravenswood-trail) all to myself after work one day and it was amazing!
It's super fucked up that they close the trail for so much of the year so that enthusiast waterfowl hunters can kill things.
There's not really any parking (great!) but that probably means that hunters bring their lifted trucks on to the trail.

## Niles Canyon

Highway 84 was closed to cars on the 23rd for [Stroll & Roll](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://www.84strollroll.com/). A bunch of us took BART to West Dublin and then took Foothill Rd (not ideal but was fine in a group) south to Sunol. This was sort of the catalyzing event on a longer ride from Niles Canyon to Sunnyvale via the Alameda Creek Trail and Bay Trail. tbh Niles Canyon was the least exciting part of the ride and there were way too many cops who showed up for PR.

## Alameda Creek Trail

They have hundreds of goats on the trail!! They're used strategically for [resource management](https://www.ebparks.org/natural-resources/grazing). Eat that invasive grass, goats!

One tried to escape!

## Coyote Hills Regional Park

Kat and I will definitely be coming back here to explore some more.

## Bay Trail

It's been a long time since I've ridden large sections of the Bay Trail down in the peninsula. The salt is always fun to look at.

Spectacular moon rise on the 27th.

The views of the old Dumbarton Rail Bridge are cute!

## Shoreline Trail

The views coming up to the Dumbarton Bridge are incredible! You can see all the [wetland restoration](https://www.southbayrestoration.org) being done.

## Around San Francisco

The wildfires up north gave us several days of poor air quality. One day we rode around masked up.

Market St vibes.

I'd love to know more about this area near Crane Cove Park.

Battery Caulfield descent out of the Presidio. This is my favourite way to get out of the Presidio when the traffic is light.

There was a downed tree on the old growth oak forest network ðŸ˜­

Riding around the Presidio at night.

My favourite day ride with Kat included a rare stop at Woods on Polk. Best bike in the city.

Kat has been watching this family of ducks at Lake Metson grow up and it's one of my favourite things ever. I deeply regret not getting to come here and watch the ducks with my dear friend Hansel as it was one of their favourite spots.

## Hawk and Golden Gate Bridge

I started the month with a lot of momentum and tested the ebike up Hawk Hill a few times.

{{< image src="DSCF3551.webp" alt="The sun over Marin hills next to the Pacific ocean with a winding road" >}}

I had some really pleasant bridge crossings this month too!

{{< image src="DSCF3555.webp" alt="A bike path on the golden gate bridge with motion blurred cars on the left and the Pacific ocean on the right" >}}

I don't normally stop on the bridge due to the wind/chaos but this time I had it nearly to myself and the wind was gentle.

Typical view.
