## Ravenswood Trail

I had this trail all to myself after work one day and it was amazing!
It's super fucked up that they close the trail for so much of the year so that enthusiast waterfowl hunters can kill things.
There's not really any parking (great!) but that probably means that hunters bring their lifted trucks on to the trail.

## Alameda Creek Trail

They have hundreds of goats on the trail!! They're used strategically for [resource management](https://www.ebparks.org/natural-resources/grazing).
