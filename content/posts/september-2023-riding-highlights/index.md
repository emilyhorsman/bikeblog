## Ravenswood Trail

I had [this trail](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/don-edwards-san-francisco-bay/map?trail=ravenswood-trail) all to myself after work one day and it was amazing!
It's super fucked up that they close the trail for so much of the year so that enthusiast waterfowl hunters can kill things.
There's not really any parking (great!) but that probably means that hunters bring their lifted trucks on to the trail.

## Niles Canyon

Highway 84 was closed to cars on the 23rd for [Stroll & Roll](https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/https://www.84strollroll.com/). A bunch of us took BART to West Dublin and then took Foothill Rd (not ideal but was fine in a group) south to Sunol. This was sort of the catalyzing event on a longer ride from Niles Canyon to Sunnyvale via the Alameda Creek Trail and Bay Trail. tbh Niles Canyon was the least exciting part of the ride and there were way too many cops who showed up for PR.

## Alameda Creek Trail

They have hundreds of goats on the trail!! They're used strategically for [resource management](https://www.ebparks.org/natural-resources/grazing). Eat that invasive grass, goats!

One tried to escape!

## Coyote Hills Regional Park

Kat and I will definitely be coming back here to explore some more.

## Bay Trail

It's been a long time since I've rode large sections of the Bay Trail down in the peninsula. The salt is always fun to look at.

Spectacular moon rise on the 27th.

The views of the old Dumbarton Rail Bridge are cute!

## Shoreline Trail

The views coming up to the Dumbarton Bridge are incredible! You can see all the [wetland restoration](https://www.southbayrestoration.org) being done.

## Around San Francisco

The wildfires up north gave us several days of poor air quality. One day we rode around masked up.

Market St vibes.
