title: Thoughts After 2000km on an E-Bike
summary: I've now put about 2000 km on my e-bike (~1250 miles) and want to write out my thoughts on an e-bike compared to a normal bike â€” the good and the bad.

## Caveats

1. I don't think I've owned an e-bike long enough to have solid opinions. I expect a lot of these takes to change. Thus, this post is a sort of signpost of my thoughts on e-bikes after a few months.
1. I haven't carried kids or pets on this bike and it's not a cargo bike.[^3]
1. This has been my do-everything bike for the last three months. I've ridden it on and off the road, carried heavy loads up steep San Francisco hills without running out of breath, and attached a Burley trailer to it to get 40 lbs of firewood up to the Presidio. So, while these are preliminary opinions, I think they're well-informed.

[^3]: It's not a long-tail, bakfiet, or other specialized cargo bike. It's just a standard double-triangle bike with an 1127 mm wheelbase and no integrated racks.

## Politics

1. Some claim that e-bikes have a lower carbon footprint per mile than a traditional bike. Whether this is true or not I still think that a lot of e-bikes will become e-waste and that the mining involved in battery production is terrible for our planet. Getting people on traditional bikes instead of e-bikes should be a goal when possible.
1. Many people aren't well served by the bikes they're familiar with because the bike industry predominantly sells uncomfortable bikes with low utility and too-hard gears. I still think that many people wouldn't get an e-bike if they had a regular bike that was comfortable for them, had dynamo lights, and a wide range of gears that were low enough to carry lots of stuff up big hills.

## PeopleForBikes Three-Class System

[PeopleForBikes](https://www.peopleforbikes.org/electric-bikes/policies-and-laws) has model legislation defining three different classes of e-bikes. Many states here in the US have adopted this three-class system. The tl;dr is this:

1. Class 1 assists up to 20 mph only while pedaling.
1. Class 2 assists up to 20 mph and has a throttle to assist without pedaling.
1. Class 3 assists up to 28 mph only[^1] while pedaling.

[^1]: There are also [e-bikes](https://www.specialized.com/us/en/haul-st/p/200057), arguably outside California law, which advertise themselves as a Class 3 e-bike but have a throttle that assists up to 20 mph. The three-class system states that Class 3 e-bikes provide ["assistance only when the rider is pedaling,"](https://peopleforbikes.cdn.prismic.io/peopleforbikes/26118e07-5b1b-4159-92eb-5bd5d684f9b2_E-Bike-Law-Primer_July+2023.pdf) so these probably shouldn't exist.

I think it's very difficult to justify the existence of class 2 and 3 e-bikes.[^2] I think there are good accessibility reasons to have a throttle but I'm not convinced it needs to assist as high as 20 mph or be kept on indefinitely. 20 mph is _fast_. I've test-ridden long-tail cargo bikes that assist up to 28 mph and the difference I feel in the power dynamic between myself and other road users is scary.

[^2]: I would say I have high-medium confidence in this opinion.

## Riding Patterns

1. I fucking love riding my e-bike!
1. I bought this after over a year of chronic wrist pain affecting nearly every aspect of my life, including riding. I was hoping that blah blah new joy in biking blah blah distracting from pain
1. I'll take safer/less trafficked but hillier roads that I wouldn't take on a normal bike.
1. It lets me get around even after a long day or after I'm tired from strength training.
1. The motor lets you make different bike fit tradeoffs (e.g., a lower saddle position than I'd generally ride which is comfier on the saddle but would be typically less comfy on my joints).[^4] Even different contact point tradeoffs such as tire choice and pressure.
1. Your weight is distributed across all your contact points: handlebars, saddle, and pedals. I find that biking at a particularly chill pace on a normal bike results in putting less weight into my pedals and thus more weight on my handlebars and saddle. This can result in discomfort faster.

## Assist Experience

1. The assist algorithm is very, very good. It feels shockingly natural. It's much better than the hub-motor bike share e-bikes in San Francisco.
1. Occasionally I'll get moments where the motor seems to flicker off or is out of parity with my effort. I haven't totally noticed a pattern with this but it seems to be when my bike is asymmetrically loaded. I'm curious if other e-bike riders get this sometimes.
1. It's surprisingly quiet!
1. The drag you feel when the motor assists minimally or not at all could be better. I think I've maybe "broken in" mine a bit and the drag feels less bad than it did when I first got the bike. I remember trying the lowest assist level right away and not liking it; now I don't mind it so much. I may have just gotten used to it.
1. The range on this 504 Wh battery is excellent.

[^4]: I've been leaning away from this over time and as I go on harder rides.

## Maintenance

1. This thing definitely wears through consumables faster. I've already gotten to 0.5% wear on this chain.
