This is my primary bike that I do just about everything on, almost every day. It's a blue Kona Dew-E e-bike that I got in July 2023. I try to record all maintenance and tweaks I make on it in the posts below. I've swapped the stock drivetrain (the mechanical part of it, anyway) and contact points. It's running a Shimano STEPS E6100 motor.
